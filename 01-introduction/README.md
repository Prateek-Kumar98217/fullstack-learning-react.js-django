# Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Full-Stack Development

This section provides a foundation in full-stack development concepts, tools, and basic technologies. You'll learn the essential building blocks before diving into specific frameworks.

## Learning Path

| Day | Topic | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | [Development Environment Setup](day-1-2-setup/README.md) | Setting up your development environment, understanding version control, and learning command line basics |
| 3-4 | [Frontend Basics](day-3-4-frontend-basics/README.md) | HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals for modern web development |
| 5-7 | [Git & GitHub Basics](day-5-7-git-basics/README.md) | Version control, branching strategies, and collaborative workflows |

## Why This Matters

Full-stack development requires understanding both frontend and backend technologies, as well as the tools and processes that connect them. This foundation will prepare you for the more specialized frameworks and libraries you'll learn in subsequent weeks.

## What You'll Learn

- Essential development tools and environments
- Fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Version control with Git and collaborative workflow with GitHub

## Prerequisites

This course assumes basic computer literacy and some familiarity with web concepts, but no prior programming experience is required for this introductory section.

## Projects

Throughout this section, you'll build:

1. A personal portfolio website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. A simple interactive web application
3. A collaborative project using Git and GitHub

## Next Steps

After completing this section, you'll move on to [React Basics](../week-2-3-react-basics/README.md) where you'll learn how to build interactive user interfaces with React.

## How This Builds Your Foundation

```

Understanding these foundational elements is crucial because:

1. They form the building blocks of more complex frameworks
2. They remain relevant regardless of which frameworks you use
3. They provide context for understanding how modern tools solve common problems
4. They enable you to debug issues across the stack
