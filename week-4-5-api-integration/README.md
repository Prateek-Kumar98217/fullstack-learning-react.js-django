# Week 4-5: API Integration

This section focuses on building and consuming APIs, the critical bridge between your frontend and backend applications. You'll learn how to design, implement, and interact with different API types.

## Learning Path

| Day | Topic | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 22-23 | [REST API Fundamentals](day-22-23-rest-fundamentals/README.md) | Understanding REST principles, HTTP methods, status codes, and designing RESTful endpoints |
| 24-25 | [Django REST Framework](day-24-25-django-rest/README.md) | Building APIs with Django REST Framework, serializers, viewsets, and authentication |
| 26-27 | [Consuming APIs in React](day-26-27-react-apis/README.md) | Fetching data, handling states, error boundaries, and state management with APIs |
| 28-29 | [Advanced API Patterns](day-28-29-advanced-patterns/README.md) | GraphQL, WebSockets, authentication strategies, and API testing |

## Why APIs Matter

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the glue that connects different parts of your application stack. In modern full-stack development, where frontend and backend are often written in different languages (React/TypeScript and Python/Django in our case), well-designed APIs ensure smooth communication between these components.

## What You'll Learn

- HTTP fundamentals and RESTful design principles
- Building robust APIs with Django REST Framework
- Consuming APIs effectively in React applications
- Advanced patterns like GraphQL and real-time communication
- Authentication and security best practices
- Testing and documenting APIs

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, you should be comfortable with:

- React basics (Week 2-3)
- TypeScript fundamentals (Week 3)
- Django basics (Week 4)
- HTTP and basic web concepts

## Projects

Throughout this section, you'll build:

1. A RESTful API for a task management application
2. A React frontend that consumes your API
3. Integration tests to verify your API functions correctly
4. API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

## How This Connects The Stack

```

Understanding APIs is crucial because:

1. They define how your frontend and backend communicate
2. They establish data contracts between system components
3. They enable parallel development of frontend and backend
4. They provide security boundaries between system layers
5. They allow you to integrate with third-party services
