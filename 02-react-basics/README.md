# Weeks 2-3: React Basics

This section focuses on React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You'll learn the fundamentals of React, including components, state management, and hooks.

## Learning Path

| Day | Topic | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 15-16 | [Introduction to React](day-15-16-intro/README.md) | Understanding React's core concepts, virtual DOM, and component-based architecture |
| 17-18 | [Components & Props](day-17-18-components/README.md) | Creating functional and class components, passing data with props |
| 19-20 | [State & Lifecycle](day-19-20-state-lifecycle/README.md) | Managing component state, lifecycle methods, and re-renders |
| 21 | [Events & Forms](day-21-events-forms/README.md) | Handling user interactions, controlled vs. uncontrolled forms |
| 12-13 | [Hooks](day-12-13-hooks/README.md) | Using useState, useEffect, and custom hooks in functional components |
| 14-15 | [Routing & Navigation](day-14-15-routing/README.md) | Implementing client-side routing with React Router |

## Why React Matters

React revolutionized frontend development by introducing a component-based approach to building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state, making it easier to build and maintain complex applications.

## What You'll Learn

- React's core concepts and philosophy
- Component-based architecture
- State management in React
- Hooks for functional components
- Handling user interactions
- Building single-page applications with routing

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, you should be comfortable with:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals (Week 1)
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- Basic DOM manipulation

## Projects

Throughout this section, you'll build:

1. A task management application with components and state
2. A multi-page application with React Router
3. A form-based application with validation

## How React Fits in Full-Stack Development

```

React serves as the view layer in modern web applications, handling:

1. UI rendering and updates
2. Component-based architecture for reusability
3. State management within components
4. Side effects and lifecycle management
5. Client-side routing
