# Next.js + Django Projects

This directory contains full-stack projects using Next.js for the frontend and Django for the backend. These projects showcase modern web development techniques using Next.js's powerful features alongside Django's robust backend capabilities.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Modern Blog
A blog platform with server-side rendering, API routes, and a headless CMS approach.

**Key Features:**
- Server-side rendering for improved SEO
- API routes for simple operations
- Django as a headless CMS
- Authentication with NextAuth.js
- Markdown/rich text support
- SEO optimization

### 2. E-commerce Store
A complete e-commerce solution with static product pages, dynamic cart management, and secure payment integration.

**Key Features:**
- Static product pages for performance
- Dynamic cart management
- Hybrid rendering (SSG + ISR + SSR)
- Django REST Framework integration
- Stripe payment processing
- Order management system

### 3. Enterprise Dashboard
A sophisticated analytics dashboard with real-time data visualization and role-based access control.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time data visualization
- Server components for efficient rendering
- Complex data fetching patterns
- Role-based access control
- Performance monitoring
- Responsive design

## Integration Patterns

Next.js and Django can be integrated in several ways:

1. **API-based Integration**: Next.js frontend consumes Django REST API
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Next.js API routes for simple operations, Django API for complex operations
3. **Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern**: Next.js API routes act as a middleware
4. **Monorepo Approach**: Both frontend and backend in a single repository

## Key Advantages

### Performance Benefits
- Static Generation (SSG) for maximum performance
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for dynamic content with static-like performance
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for dynamic content that needs SEO
- Server Components for efficient rendering without client-side JavaScript
- API Routes for backend logic without additional server setup

### Development Experience
- Full-stack TypeScript support
- Hot module replacement
- Integrated routing
- Built-in image optimization
- Zero-config deployment options

### Django Integration Benefits
- Robust ORM and database migrations
- Advanced admin interface
- Security features
- Authentication and permissions
- Scalable architecture

## Getting Started

Each project includes comprehensive setup instructions in its own README.md file. The general approach is:

1. Set up the Django backend with Django REST Framework
2. Configure CORS to allow requests from Next.js
3. Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript
4. Implement API fetching using SWR or React Query
5. Configure environment variables for API endpoints

## Learning Path

These projects advance in complexity:

1. Start with the **Modern Blog** to learn basic Next.js + Django integration
2. Move to the **E-commerce Store** to tackle more complex state management
3. Finally, build the **Enterprise Dashboard** to implement advanced features
