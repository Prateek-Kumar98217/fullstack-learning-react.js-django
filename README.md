# Full-Stack Development Learning Path

A comprehensive learning repository for full-stack development with React, TypeScript, and Django.

## Repository Overview

This repository provides a structured learning path for full-stack web development, focusing on modern technologies:
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Next.js
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Integration**: Full-stack application development

The content is organized into **topic-based modules** rather than week-based folders, making it easier to find specific technologies and concepts.

### Projects Directory

The `projects` directory contains practical applications that apply concepts from the modules:

#### Individual Project Directories

- **Todo App**: A vanilla JavaScript todo application with local storage
- **TypeScript App**: A todo application refactored with TypeScript
- **Django Blog**: A full-featured blog application built with Django

- **Blog Platform**: A complete React + Django REST blog platform
- **Portfolio**: A professional portfolio site template
- **Final Project**: A capstone SaaS application project

#### Full-Stack Project Tracks

The repository also features two parallel tracks of full-stack projects:

**Track A: React + Django Projects**
- Basic Blog: React frontend with Django REST backend
- E-commerce Platform: Complete online store
- Social Media Dashboard: Interactive application with real-time features

**Track B: Next.js + Django Projects**
- Modern Blog: SSR blog application
- E-commerce Store: Next.js-powered store
- Enterprise Dashboard: Advanced data visualization

## Learning Paths

This structure allows for flexible learning approaches:

### Track A: React + Django
Traditional full-stack approach combining React frontend with Django backend.

### Track B: Next.js + Django
Modern full-stack approach using Next.js with Django as a backend.

### Frontend Focus
01-introduction → 02-react-basics → 03-typescript → 05-api-integration (frontend parts) → 06-frontend-backend-integration → 09-testing-deployment → 11-nextjs

### Backend Focus
01-introduction → 04-django-basics → 05-api-integration → 06-frontend-backend-integration → 08-advanced-concepts → 09-testing-deployment → 10-optimization

### Full-Stack Path

4. **Review regularly**: Revisit concepts as needed to reinforce your understanding.

5. **Apply to personal projects**: Try implementing what you've learned in your own projects.

### Module Dependencies

While modules build on each other, here are the primary dependencies:

- Module 03 (TypeScript) builds on Module 02 (React Basics)
- Module 05 (API Integration) builds on Module 04 (Django Basics)
- Module 06 (Frontend-Backend Integration) builds on Modules 02, 03, 04, and 05
- Module 07 (Fullstack Applications) builds on Module 06
- Module 11 (Next.js) builds on Modules 02 and 03

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with programming concepts
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
- Git installed

## Customizing Your Learning Journey

Don't feel obligated to follow the exact order if you already have experience in certain areas:

- If you're familiar with React, you might skim 02-react-basics
- If you know TypeScript, you can move quickly through 03-typescript
- If Django is familiar, you can focus on the parts of 04-django-basics that are new to you
