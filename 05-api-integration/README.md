# Weeks 4-5: API Integration

This section focuses on API development and integration, bridging the gap between frontend and backend technologies. You'll learn how to design RESTful APIs with Django REST Framework and consume them in your React applications.

## Learning Path

| Day | Topic | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 22-23 | [REST API Fundamentals](day-22-23-rest-fundamentals/README.md) | REST principles, API design, HTTP methods, status codes, and resource modeling |
| 24-25 | [Django REST Framework](day-24-25-django-rest/README.md) | Serializers, views, viewsets, authentication, and permissions |
| 26-27 | [Consuming APIs in React](day-26-27-react-apis/README.md) | Fetch API, Axios, handling async data, error handling, and loading states |
| 28-29 | [Advanced API Patterns](day-28-29-advanced-patterns/README.md) | GraphQL, real-time communication, caching, and performance optimization |

## Why APIs Matter

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the glue that connects different parts of your application stack. In modern full-stack development, where frontend and backend are often written in different languages (React/TypeScript and Python/Django in our case), well-designed APIs ensure smooth communication between these components.

## What You'll Learn

- REST API design principles and best practices
- Building APIs with Django REST Framework
- Consuming APIs in React applications
- Advanced patterns for API integration
- Authentication and authorization in APIs

## Projects

Throughout this section, you'll build:

1. A RESTful API for a blog application with Django REST Framework
2. A React frontend that consumes your API
3. An authenticated API with user-specific data

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, you should be comfortable with:

- React fundamentals (Weeks 2-3)
- Django basics (Week 4)
- JavaScript async/await

## Next Steps

After completing this section, you'll move on to [Full-Stack Integration](../week-6-7-fullstack-integration/README.md) where you'll learn how to build complete full-stack applications.

## How This Connects The Stack

```

└─────────────────┘       └─────────────────┘       └─────────────────┘
```

Understanding APIs is crucial because:

1. They define how your frontend and backend communicate
2. They establish data contracts between system components
3. They enable parallel development of frontend and backend
4. They provide security boundaries between system layers
5. They allow you to integrate with third-party services
